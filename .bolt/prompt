For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured, functional and ready for production using frontend JAM Stack javascript with REST html forms that interact with Google-hosted Rust backend using the Google Gemini CLI, Google Gemini API, and/or gemini_client_rust and/or Leptos Rust SQLx.

Backend SQL data schema reside at:

Backend SQL data schema is SuiteCRM which is akin to Salesforce and Microsoft Dynamics.

Store private keys in a separate file from the main cargo.toml file.

Frontend JAM Stack javascript will include API Configuration and State Management.

Frontend javascript will include:
const API_BASE = 'http://localhost:8080/membersense/api'; // Update this to match your Rust backend URL

Frontend javascript display and interactivity will work without running a build.
